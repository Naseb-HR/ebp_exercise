# Analytic Exercise for Evidence Based Practice Training - Instructions for administrators

## How to run this training

**Option 1:**  Give this data to individuals or small groups and ask them to compile a written report.  I would encourage people to post their report publicly and open it up for critique from the analytics community.

**Option 2:**  
* Give this data to individuals or small groups.  After a certain time period allowed for analytics, have the group present their findings to a panel of three role-played executives, each with an ingoing set of beliefs about the situation.  
* Sample role play scripts can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e9ywid_kste7ob5vgYpCXxYTANLfwMUY/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.  
* It is recommended that a knowledgeable and experienced practitioner act as an independent observer during the role plays, and provide feedback to participants afterwards.  However, role play actors can also provide feedback.
